                        “prior-life” work experience on the patent prosecution and litigation side of the IP world.  
                        This IP legal background enables her to bridge the legal and tech needs of a platform user from a pragmatic,
                         real-world IP space perspective. She is fascinated by the intersection of AI SaaS/SEM, computational design and patent search analytics powered by machine learning. Her passion is to shape IP workflow management, 
                        analytics, & transactions in a much more dynamic, intuitive and easier way than ever before.""</p>
